# Silver Fox Marketing Order Processing System

## 🚨 CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE (July 30, 2025)

### Current State: Order Processing Wizard v2.0 Interface Issues

**Primary Issue**: While the Order Processing Wizard v2.0 exists with all implemented features (manual data editor, QR verification system), the workflow execution is not functioning properly. The wizard shows "0 vehicles processed" and does not display the manual editing or QR verification steps during the workflow.

### 🎯 System Overview

The Silver Fox Marketing Order Processing System is a comprehensive web-based solution for managing dealership vehicle graphics orders. It integrates with a PostgreSQL database containing scraped vehicle inventory data and generates Adobe InDesign variable data libraries with corresponding QR codes.

### 📊 Key Metrics
- **Total Dealership Scrapers**: 40 configured
- **Currently Working**: 8 scrapers (20% coverage)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with dealership_vehicles table
- **Order Types**: CAO (Check Against Orders) and LIST (Direct List Processing)

### 🔧 Recent Development Progress

#### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Real-time Scraper Console Output**
   - Created `scripts/scraper_manager.py` with WebSocket support
   - Implemented live streaming of scraper stdout/stderr
   - Added console display in web interface

2. **Order Processing Wizard v2.0**
   - Built comprehensive multi-step wizard interface
   - Implemented manual data editor (line 953 in order_wizard.js)
   - Created QR URL editor functionality (line 1066)
   - Added inline cell editing for CSV data
   - Integrated QR code generation (388x388 PNG)

3. **Flask Application Updates**
   - Fixed duplicate route definitions
   - Added graceful error handling for missing dependencies
   - Implemented WebSocket endpoints for real-time updates
   - Added QR folder download endpoint

4. **Frontend Improvements**
   - Fixed browser caching issues with cache-busting
   - Added version identification (v2.0) to wizard header
   - Updated downloadAllFiles() with proper implementation
   - Fixed window.wizard initialization issues

### ❌ Critical Issues

1. **Order Processing Workflow Not Executing**
   - Wizard loads but shows "0 vehicles processed"
   - Manual data editor step not appearing after review
   - QR verification interface not accessible during workflow
   - processCaoOrder() and processListOrder() not returning vehicle data

2. **Missing Integration Points**
   - Workflow doesn't properly query database for new vehicles
   - VIN comparison logic not executing
   - CSV generation not creating output files
   - QR code generation not triggered

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Python Flask with SocketIO
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live updates
- **QR Generation**: Python qrcode library
- **Data Processing**: pandas for CSV manipulation

### 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Debug Order Processing Workflow**
   ```python
   # Check process_queue.py integration
   # Verify database queries are executing
   # Ensure vehicle data is being returned
   ```

2. **Fix Manual Data Editor Display**
   ```javascript
   // Ensure showManualDataEditor() is called after review
   // Check stepIndex progression in wizard
   // Verify data binding for inline editing
   ```

3. **Enable QR Verification Flow**
   ```javascript
   // Make QR URL editor accessible
   // Implement verification logic
   // Add regeneration capability
   ```

4. **Test End-to-End Workflow**
   - Create test order with known vehicles
   - Verify CSV export functionality
   - Confirm QR code generation
   - Test file download process

### 📝 Known Working Components

1. **Database Connection**: ✅ Verified working
2. **Scraper System**: ✅ 8 scrapers operational
3. **Web Interface**: ✅ Loads and displays properly
4. **Manual Data Editor**: ✅ Code exists but not displaying
5. **QR URL Editor**: ✅ Code exists but not accessible

### 🔍 Debugging Information

**Key Files to Check**:
- `web_gui/static/js/order_wizard.js` - Lines 450-650 (processOrder functions)
- `scripts/process_queue.py` - Database query logic
- `web_gui/app.py` - Routes: `/api/order/process-cao`, `/api/order/process-list`

**Console Errors to Monitor**:
- Network tab for API call failures
- Console for JavaScript errors during workflow
- Flask logs for backend processing issues

### 💡 Context for Next Session

When resuming development, focus on:
1. The `processOrder()` method in order_wizard.js (line ~450)
2. Why `processCaoOrder()` returns 0 vehicles
3. The step progression logic that should show manual editor
4. Database query execution in the Flask routes

The system architecture is sound and all components exist - the issue is in the workflow execution and data flow between frontend and backend.
