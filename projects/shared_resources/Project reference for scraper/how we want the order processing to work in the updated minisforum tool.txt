1. Check the order input timeline for the CAO schedule->when referencing this timeline, understand that both como input info, as well as input info mean that it will be a list order. There are two types of main order process CAO (comparative analysis order) and list-based ones, where we are given a transcribed list of vehicle vins without our graphics by our on-lot installers.
2. Every morning we will have an automated/scheduled scrape at 4 AM. This will be a scraper for all of our dealerships, so that we can get all of the raw data for the day. Since we get orders for different dealerships up until about 3pm in the afternoon, we need to scrape all dealerships in the morning, so that we can batch out our order submission/processing as they come in. Update the vin log for the dealerships last order, new vins are generated via a template on the billing sheet. 
3. Next, we import the complete scraper data from that morning, and filter the cars from each dealerships' order we are processing based on whether said dealerships' request new/certified pre-owned/pre-owned/etc
4. Then compare two lists to determine new vehicles on that given dealerships lot. 
5. Then the new order processing apps script is run, which also generates the qr codes
6. Output for each dealership should look be the qr file paths for each vehicle (relating back to its url) as well as the .csv file for adobe.
