# Calmetta Fonts for Silver Fox Marketing

This directory should contain the Calmetta font files for proper brand styling:

## Required Font Files:
- `Calmetta-Xbold.woff2` - Extra bold weight in WOFF2 format
- `Calmetta-Xbold.woff` - Extra bold weight in WOFF format (fallback)
- `Calmetta-Regular.woff2` - Regular weight in WOFF2 format
- `Calmetta-Regular.woff` - Regular weight in WOFF format (fallback)

## Usage:
These fonts are referenced in `static/css/style.css` and provide the Silver Fox Marketing brand typography for:
- Headers and titles (Calmetta Xbold)
- Accent text and branding (Calmetta Regular)

## Fallback:
If these font files are not available, the system will fall back to Montserrat (loaded from Google Fonts) which provides similar styling.

## Installation:
Add the actual Calmetta font files to this directory to enable proper brand styling.
