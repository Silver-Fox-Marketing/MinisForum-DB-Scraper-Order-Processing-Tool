## 🔄 Data Flow Architecture

### 1. Initialization Phase
```
Scraper Initialize → Load Optimization Framework → Configure Tier-Specific Settings
```

### 2. API Attempt Phase
```
DealerOn API Request → Apply Timing Optimization → Parse Response → Validate Data
```

### 3. Chrome Fallback Phase (if API fails)
```
Enhanced Chrome Setup → Stealth Script Injection → Page Navigation → Element Detection
```

### 4. Data Processing Phase
```
Raw Data → Model Detection → Price Validation → Normalization → Output
```

## 🎓 Developer Quick Start Guide

### 1. Setting Up a New Luxury Dealership Scraper

```python
# Step 1: Import optimization framework
from utils.ranch_mirage_antibot_utils import RanchMirageOptimizationFramework

# Step 2: Initialize with appropriate tier
optimizer = RanchMirageOptimizationFramework("luxury")  # or "supercar" or "ultra_luxury"

# Step 3: Integrate in scraper __init__
class NewLuxuryDealershipScraper(DealershipScraperBase):
    def __init__(self, dealership_config, scraper_config=None):
        super().__init__(dealership_config, scraper_config)
        self.optimizer = optimizer
        self.headers['User-Agent'] = self.optimizer.user_agent_manager.get_rotating_agent()

# Step 4: Apply optimization in scraping methods
def _scrape_with_api(self):
    self.optimizer.apply_request_optimization("api")
    # ... existing API logic

def _scrape_with_chrome(self):
    self.driver = self.optimizer.get_optimized_chrome_driver()
    # ... existing Chrome logic
```

### 2. Key Integration Points

**Required Optimization Calls:**
- `self.optimizer.apply_request_optimization("api")` - Before API requests
- `self.optimizer.get_optimized_chrome_driver()` - For Chrome setup
- `self.optimizer.get_page_load_delay()` - For page timing
- `self.optimizer.log_optimization_stats()` - For monitoring
